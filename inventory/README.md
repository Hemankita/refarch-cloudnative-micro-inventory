### Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Inventory Microservice. The inventory microservice uses MySQL database as its datasource. It has the complete list of items of our store front. 

- Based on [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).
- Uses MySQL as the inventory database.
- Deployment options for Minikube environment and ICP.

### How it works

Inventory Microservice serves 'IBM Cloud Native Reference Architecture' suite, available at https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes, Microservice-based reference application. Though it is a part of a bigger application, Inventory service is itself an application in turn that manages the data from data store. Catalog Microservice serves as the cache to the Inventory.

### Implementation

#### [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)

MicroProfile is an open platform that optimizes the Enterprise Java for microservices architecture. In this application, we are using [**MicroProfile 1.2**](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom). This includes

- MicroProfile 1.0 ([JAX-RS 2.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339), [CDI 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346), and [JSON-P 1.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
- MicroProfile 1.1 (MicroProfile 1.0, [MicroProfile Config 1.0.](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config))
- [MicroProfile Config 1.1](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) (supercedes MicroProfile Config 1.0), [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance), [MicroProfile Health Check 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health), [MicroProfile Metrics 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics), [MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth).

You can make use of this feature by including this dependency in Maven.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
<artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
<version>1.2</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

You should also include a feature in [server.xml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory/blob/microprofile/inventory/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml).

```
<server description="Sample Liberty server">

  <featureManager>
      <feature>microprofile-1.2</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <httpEndpoint httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}"
      id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />

</server>
```
### Features

1. Java SE 8 - Used Java Programming language

2. CDI 1.2 - Used CDI for typesafe dependency injection

3. JAX-RS 2.0.1 - JAX-RS is used for providing both standard client and server APIs for RESTful communication by MicroProfile applications.

4. Eclipse MicroProfile Config 1.1 - Configuration data comes from different sources like system properties, system environment variables, .properties etc. These values may change dynamically. Using this feature, helps us to pick up configured values immediately after they got changed.

The config values are sorted according to their ordinal. We can override the lower importance values from outside. The config sources by default, below is the order of importance.

- System.getProperties()
- System.getenv()
- all META-INF/microprofile-config.properties files on the ClassPath.

In our sample application, we obtained the configuration programatically.

### Building the app

To build the application, we used maven build. Maven is a project management tool that is based on the Project Object Model (POM). Typically, people use Maven for project builds, dependencies, and documentation. Maven simplifies the project build. In this task, you use Maven to build the project.

1. Clone this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory.git`
   
   `cd refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory/`

2. Checkout MicroProfile branch.

   `git checkout microprofile`

3. `cd inventory`

4. Run this command. This command builds the project and installs it.

   `mvn install`
   
   If this runs successfully, you will be able to see the below messages.

```

### Setting up MYSQL

#### MYSQL Pre-requisites

1. Set Up MYSQL on Minikube

To set up MYSQL locally on your laptop on a Kubernetes-based environment such as Minikube (which is meant to be a small development environment), we first need to get few tools installed:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) (Kubernetes CLI) - Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to install it on your platform.
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Kubernetes package manager) - Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) to install it on your platform.

Finally, we must create a Kubernetes Cluster. As already said before, we are going to use Minikube:

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) - Create a single node virtual cluster on your workstation. Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) to get Minikube installed on your workstation.

We not only recommend to complete the three Minikube installation steps on the link above but also read the [Running Kubernetes Locally via Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) page for getting more familiar with Minikube. 

2. Set Up MYSQL on IBM Cloud Private

To set up MYSQL on IBM Cloud Private, you need to have the following.

[IBM Cloud Private Cluster](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

Create a Kubernetes cluster in an on-premise datacenter. The community edition (IBM Cloud private-ce) is free of charge.
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html) to install IBM Cloud private-ce.

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Kubernetes package manager)

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) to install it on your platform.
If using IBM Cloud Private version 2.1.0.2 or newer, we recommend you follow these [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/app_center/create_helm_cli.html) to install helm.

#### Set Up MYSQL on Minikube

1. Start your minikube. Run the below command.

`minikube start`

You will see output similar to this.

```
Setting up certs...

### Remotely in ICP

[IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

IBM Private Cloud has all the advantages of public cloud but is dedicated to single organization. You can have your own security requirements and customize the environment as well. Basically it has tight security and gives you more control along with scalability and easy to deploy options. You can run it externally or behind the firewall of your organization.

Basically this is an on-premise platform.

Includes docker container manager
Kubernetes based container orchestrator
Graphical user interface
You can find the detailed installation instructions for IBM Cloud Private [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html)
