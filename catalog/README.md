### Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Catalog Microservice. The catalog microservice uses Elastic Search and serves as cache to the Inventory service. 

- Based on [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).
- Uses Elasticsearch.
- Deployment options for Minikube environment and ICP.

### How it works

Catalog Microservice serves 'IBM Cloud Native Reference Architecture' suite, available at https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-kubernetes, Microservice-based reference application. Though it is a part of a bigger application, Catalog service is itself an application in turn that serves as cache to the Inventory Service.

### API Endpoints

```
GET     /catalog/rest/items/              # Returns all items in inventory
GET     /catalog/rest/items/{id}          # Returns item by id 
```
### Implementation

#### [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)

MicroProfile is an open platform that optimizes the Enterprise Java for microservices architecture. In this application, we are using [**MicroProfile 1.2**](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom). This includes

- MicroProfile 1.0 ([JAX-RS 2.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339), [CDI 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346), and [JSON-P 1.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
- MicroProfile 1.1 (MicroProfile 1.0, [MicroProfile Config 1.0.](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config))
- [MicroProfile Config 1.1](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) (supercedes MicroProfile Config 1.0), [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance), [MicroProfile Health Check 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health), [MicroProfile Metrics 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics), [MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth).

You can make use of this feature by including this dependency in Maven.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
<artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
<version>1.2</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

You should also include a feature in [server.xml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory/blob/microprofile/catalog/src/main/liberty/config/server.xml).

```
<server description="Sample Liberty server">

  <featureManager>
      <feature>microprofile-1.2</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <httpEndpoint httpPort="${default.http.port}" httpsPort="${default.https.port}"
      id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" />

</server>
```
### Features

1. Java SE 8 - Used Java Programming language

2. CDI 1.2 - Used CDI for typesafe dependency injection

3. JAX-RS 2.0.1 - JAX-RS is used for providing both standard client and server APIs for RESTful communication by MicroProfile applications.

4. Eclipse MicroProfile Config 1.1 - Configuration data comes from different sources like system properties, system environment variables, .properties etc. These values may change dynamically. Using this feature, helps us to pick up configured values immediately after they got changed.

The config values are sorted according to their ordinal. We can override the lower importance values from outside. The config sources by default, below is the order of importance.

- System.getProperties()
- System.getenv()
- all META-INF/microprofile-config.properties files on the ClassPath.

In our sample application, we obtained the configuration programatically.

### Building the app

To build the application, we used maven build. Maven is a project management tool that is based on the Project Object Model (POM). Typically, people use Maven for project builds, dependencies, and documentation. Maven simplifies the project build. In this task, you use Maven to build the project.

1. Clone this repository.

   `git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory.git`
   
2. `cd refarch-cloudnative-micro-inventory/`

3. Checkout MicroProfile branch.

   `git checkout microprofile`
   
4. Go to Catalog ... `cd catalog`

5. Run this command. This command builds the project and installs it.

   `mvn install`
   
   If this runs successfully, you will be able to see the below messages.
   
```

### Setting up Elasticsearch

#### Elasticsearch Pre-requisites

1. Set Up Elasticsearch on Minikube

To set up Elasticsearch locally on your laptop on a Kubernetes-based environment such as Minikube (which is meant to be a small development environment), we first need to get few tools installed:

- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) (Kubernetes CLI) - Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to install it on your platform.
- [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Kubernetes package manager) - Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) to install it on your platform.

Finally, we must create a Kubernetes Cluster. As already said before, we are going to use Minikube:

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) - Create a single node virtual cluster on your workstation. Follow the instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) to get Minikube installed on your workstation.

We not only recommend to complete the three Minikube installation steps on the link above but also read the [Running Kubernetes Locally via Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) page for getting more familiar with Minikube.

2. Set Up Elasticsearch on IBM Cloud Private

To set up Elasticsearch on IBM Cloud Private, you need to have the following.

[IBM Cloud Private Cluster](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

Create a Kubernetes cluster in an on-premise datacenter. The community edition (IBM Cloud private-ce) is free of charge.
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html) to install IBM Cloud private-ce.

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) (Kubernetes package manager)

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) to install it on your platform.
If using IBM Cloud Private version 2.1.0.2 or newer, we recommend you follow these [instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/app_center/create_helm_cli.html) to install helm.

### Running the app and stopping it

#### Pre-requisites

As Catalog service serves as cache to the Inventory service, make sure the inventory service is up and running before running the Catalog.

To run the Catalog microservice, please complete the [Building the app](#building-the-app) section before proceeding to the following steps.

1. Locally in Minikube

To run the Catalog application locally on your laptop on a Kubernetes-based environment such as Minikube (which is meant to be a small development environment) we first need to get few tools installed:

```
#### Running the application on Minikube

1. Build the docker image.

Before building the docker image, set the docker environment.

- Run the below command.

`minikube docker-env`

You will see the output similar to this.

```
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/user@ibm.com/.minikube/certs"
export DOCKER_API_VERSION="1.23"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
- For configuring your shell, run the below command.

`eval $(minikube docker-env)`

- Now run the docker build.

`docker build -t catalog-mp:v1.0.0 .`

If it is a success, you will see the below output.

```
Successfully built aee7ed946e93
Successfully tagged catalog-mp:v1.0.0
```

2. Run the helm chart as below.

`helm install --name=catalog chart/catalog`

You will see message like below.

```
==> v1beta1/Deployment
NAME                DESIRED  CURRENT  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  AGE
catalog-deployment  1        1        1           0          1s
```
Please wait till your deployment is ready. To verify run the below command and you should see the availability.

`kubectl get deployments`

You will see something like below.

```
==> v1beta1/Deployment
NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
catalog-deployment                 1         1         1            1           13m
```

3. You can access the application at `http://<MinikubeIP>:<PORT>/<WAR_CONTEXT>/<APPLICATION_PATH>/<ENDPOINT>`. To get the access url.

- To get the IP, Run this command.

`minikube ip`

You will see something like below.

```
192.168.99.100
```

- To get the port, run this command.

`kubectl get service catalog-service`

You will see something like below.

```
NAME              CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
catalog-service   10.99.41.25   <nodes>       9080:30939/TCP,9443:30146/TCP   17m
```

In the above case, the access url will be `http://192.168.99.100:30939/catalog/rest/items`.

4. Validate the catalog in the following way.

`curl -X GET http://192.168.99.100:30939/catalog/rest/items`

You should now see a list of inventory items in your terminal.

```
[{"id":13405,"name":"Electric Card Collator","description":"The IBM 77 electric punched card collator performed many card filing and pulling operations.

```
### Remotely in ICP

[IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private)

IBM Private Cloud has all the advantages of public cloud but is dedicated to single organization. You can have your own security requirements and customize the environment as well. Basically it has tight security and gives you more control along with scalability and easy to deploy options. You can run it externally or behind the firewall of your organization.

Basically this is an on-premise platform.

Includes docker container manager
Kubernetes based container orchestrator
Graphical user interface
You can find the detailed installation instructions for IBM Cloud Private [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/install_containers_CE.html)

#### Pushing the image to Private Registry

1. Now run the docker build.

`docker build -t catalog-mp:v1.0.0 .`

If it is a success, you will see the below output.

```
Successfully built aee7ed946e93
Successfully tagged catalog-mp:v1.0.0
```

2. Tag the image to your private registry.

`docker tag catalog-mp:v1.0.0 <Your ICP registry>/catalog-mp:v1.0.0`

3. Push the image to your private registry.

`docker push <Your ICP registry>/catalog-mp:v1.0.0`

You should see something like below.

```
v1.0.0: digest: sha256:7f3deb2c43854df725efde5b0a3e6977cc7b6e8e26865b484d8cb20c2e4a6dd0 size: 3873

10. You can access the application at `http://<YourClusterIP>:<PORT>/<WAR_CONTEXT>/<APPLICATION_PATH>/<ENDPOINT>`. To get the access url.

- To get the IP, Run this command.

`kubectl cluster-info`

You will see something like below.

```
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001
catalog-ui is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/catalog-ui/proxy
Heapster is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
icp-management-ingress is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/icp-management-ingress/proxy
image-manager is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/image-manager/proxy
KubeDNS is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns/proxy
platform-ui is running at https://172.16.40.4:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/platform-ui/proxy
```

Grab the Kubernetes master ip and in this case, `<YourClusterIP>` will be `172.16.40.4`.

- To get the port, run this command.

`kubectl get service catalog-service`

You will see something like below.

```
NAME              CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                         AGE
catalog-service   10.10.10.170   <nodes>       9080:32681/TCP,9443:30834/TCP   4m
```

In the above case, the access url will be `http://172.16.40.182:32681/catalog/rest/items`.
